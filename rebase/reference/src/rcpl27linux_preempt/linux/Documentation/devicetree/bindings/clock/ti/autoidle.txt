Binding for Texas Instruments autoidling clock.

This binding uses the common clock binding[1]. Autoidle clocks
are inherited clocks from basic divider-clock [2] or
fixed-factor-clock [3] and just add autoidle support on top of
this. Autoidle is an OMAP clock feature, which allows the clock
to gate autonomously by hardware when they are no longer needed.
The autoidle feature must be enabled manually for these clocks.
Otherwise the clocks behave exactly as their base clock type.

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of:
		"ti,divider-clock",
		"ti,fixed-factor-clock"
- ti,autoidle-shift : bit shift of the autoidle enable bit for the clock
- reg : base address for the control register of this clock

Optional properties:
- ti,autoidle-low : autoidle is enabled by setting the bit to 0

Other properties as per the base clock type.

Examples:
	dpll_abe_m2x2_ck: dpll_abe_m2x2_ck@4a0051f0 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,divider-clock";
		clocks = <&dpll_abe_x2_ck>;
		ti,autoidle-shift = <8>;
		reg = <0x4a0051f0 0x4>;
		bit-mask = <0x1f>;
		index-starts-at-one;
		ti,autoidle-low;
	};

	dpll_usb_clkdcoldo_ck: dpll_usb_clkdcoldo_ck@4a0081b4 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,fixed-factor-clock";
		clocks = <&dpll_usb_ck>;
		ti,autoidle-shift = <8>;
		clock-div = <1>;
		reg = <0x4a0081b4 0x4>;
		clock-mult = <1>;
		ti,autoidle-low;
	};
