Binding for Texas Instruments gate clock.

This binding uses the common clock binding[1]. This clock is
quite much similar to the basic gate-clock [2], however,
it supports a number of additional features. If no register
is provided for this clock, the code assumes that a clockdomain
will be controlled instead and the corresponding hw-ops for
that is used.

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of:
  "ti,gate-clock" - basic gate clock
  "ti,dss-gate-clock" - gate clock with DSS specific hardware handling
  "ti,am35xx-gate-clock" - gate clock with AM35xx specific hardware handling
  "ti,clkdm-gate-clock" - clockdomain gate clock, which derives its functional
			  clock directly from a clockdomain, see [3] how
			  to map clockdomains properly
  "ti,hsdiv-gate-clock" - gate clock with OMAP36xx specific hardware handling,
			  required for a hardware errata
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0
- clocks : link to phandle of parent clock
- reg : base address for register controlling adjustable gate, not needed for
	ti,clkdm-gate-clock type
- ti,enable-bit : bit shift for programming the clock gate, not needed for
		  ti,clkdm-gate-clock type

Optional properties:
- ti,set-bit-to-disable : inverts default gate programming. Setting the bit
  gates the clock and clearing the bit ungates the clock.
