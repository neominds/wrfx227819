	help
	  The LTTng 2.0 Tracer Toolchain allows integrated kernel and
	  user-space tracing from a single user interface: the "lttng"
	  command. See http://lttng.org website for the "lttng-tools"
	  user-space tracer control tools package and the "babeltrace"
	  package for conversion of trace data to a human-readable
	  format.

	  LTTng features:
	  - System-wide tracing across kernel, libraries and
	    applications,
	  - Tracepoints, detailed syscall tracing (fast strace replacement),
	    Function tracer, CPU Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) counters
	    and kprobes support,
	  - Have the ability to attach "context" information to events in the
	    trace (e.g. any PMU counter, pid, ppid, tid, comm name, etc). All
	    the extra information fields to be collected with events are
	    optional, specified on a per-tracing-session basis (except for
	    timestamp and event id, which are mandatory).
	  - Precise and fast clock sources with near cycle-level
	    timestamps,
	  - Efficient trace data transport:
	    - Compact Binary format with CTF,
	    - Per-core buffers ensures scalability,
	    - Fast-paths in caller context, amortized synchronization,
	    - Zero-copy using splice and mmap system calls, over disk,
	      network or consumed in-place,
	  - Multiple concurrent tracing sessions are supported,
	  - Designed to meet hard real-time constraints,
	  - Supports live streaming of the trace data,
	  - Produces CTF (Common Trace Format) natively (see
	    http://www.efficios.com/ctf).
