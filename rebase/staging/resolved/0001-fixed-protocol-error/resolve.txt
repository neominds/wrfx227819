CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in drivers/usb/dwc3/core.c
Rebase failed at 0001-fixed-protocol-error

suspend part in dwc3_remove is commented out in FX code.
whereas RCPL code seems to resequence it. (Free up buffers and other resources and then try to suspend/poweroff).

RCPL code part seems better way to do it. Retained RCPL code for now - if doesnt work need to revert to FX code.
