CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in drivers/usb/dwc3/gadget.c
Rebase failed at 0001-fixed-usb-gadget-isuue


1.
core.c
FX change for function dwc3_remove() seems to comment out suspend and poweroff.
RCPL27 re-orders operations and performs suspend and poweroff after freeing resources.
rcpl27 seems like a better way of doing, so retained that.
However if tests fail, may need to revert to FX change.

2. 
gadget.c
FX changes are only debug add or removal. Added same to merged file.
