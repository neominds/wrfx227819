arch/arm/mm/ioremap.c
=>

Conflicts are because of #ifdef trying to replace unsigned long to phys_addr_t.
RCPL27 also does same - #ifdef not required except in one place.

arch/arm/mm/proc-v7-3level.S
=>
RCPL27 changed registers r2 and r3 to rl and rh. Patch changes in this area are 
only whitespace and hence discarded.
